## How to read the Book

One thing is certain, no one learned programming by just reading a book. Programming is about practical experiences. It is about conquering challenges to strengthen your skills as a developer in the long term. No one learned a programming paradigm, such as functional programming or object-oriented programming, in the short term. No one learned a concept, such as state management in modern web applications, on a weekend. No one learned yet another library, such as React or Express, over one night. You will learn things only by deliberately practicing them.

In the book, I want to give you these hands on experiences and challenges to grow. The challenges are meant to create a flow experience, a scenario where the challenge meets your skills and tools at hand. Otherwise, you would feel either overwhelmed or bored. If the book accomplishes to keep this balance of challenging you and respecting your level of skill, you might experience a [state of flow](https://www.robinwieruch.de/lessons-learned-deep-work-flow/). Personally I found this insight astonishing when I read about myself, so I hope that I can induce it in this book. It would be the perfect learning experience.

### Tips & Tricks

The [JS BIN](http://jsbin.com/) online editor, that you are going to use occasionally, will not always provide all functionalities from modern browsers. For instance, you might run into problems when trying to apply JavaScript ES6 and beyond functionalities. That's why the book tries to transition to project in your own editor as soon as possible. There you have full control over your projects and can continue working on the projects even after you read the book.

As mentioned, there are guided hands on experiences in the book. There, you will be guided to solve problems by using the techniques you have learned in previous chapters. You will solve these problems in an online editor, that is already prepared, or in your own editor. It should give you the experience of applying your learnings beyond only reading a book. This book aims to go beyond only being reading material. It's supposed to be a practical hands-on guide that let's you apply your learnings in order to deepen your knowledge.

In addition, make sure to internalize each lesson learned before you continue with the next chapter. The book is written in a way that the learnings build up on each other. Your knowledge around about the taught topics will not only scale horizontally by using different techniques but also vertically by deploying technique on technique. That's why it is important to internalize each learning before your continue to read.

Another hint is **making notes while you read the book**. You can write down questions where the book doesn't give you an answer and look them up afterward. Or you can write down your learnings to internalize them. That is how I do it when I read a book. Last but not least, if you write down feedback about the book, you can send me your notes afterward. I am highly interested to improve the book all the time for keeping the quality up.

Moreover I encourage you to **write the code yourself**. Even though the book shows you the source code, don't copy and paste it, but try to write it yourself. Only this way you will get a better understanding of it. When introducing bugs this way, you have to figure out yourself what went wrong in order to fix it. So it is encouraged to introduce bugs, otherwise everything goes flawless when following only the instructions in the book, but you will not know how to come up with your own solutions in the world out there after reading the book. Only this way you will grow your skills as a developer.

Last but not least, perhaps you are able to find time in between **tinkering on your own applications for applying your recent learnings** from the book. It is the best way of learning about things in the programming world, because without ever applying the learnings yourself, you will never master them. Personally I highly recommend to come up with your own project on the side. If you have difficulties to come up with a project idea, checkout this [article](https://www.robinwieruch.de/how-to-learn-framework/).

It should be obvious by now that you will have the best outcome of this book by having a laptop on your side. That way you can directly apply your new learnings in your editor/IDE and confront yourself with the challenges from the book. As mentioned before, no one learned something by just reading a book. You are in charge to get more than only white pages with black letters out of it. You are filling it with color in between.
